This is a simple Trading Card Game or Collector Card Game API interaction
application. Basically, if there it an API for a particular TCG or CCG (or a 
variation of these types of concepts) you will be able to use this to view 
information on the cards/characters.

Not all data included is considered to be from a TCG or CCG but may be inspired
from it. For example, the PokeAPI that is being used to pull data about Pokemon
isn't based on the TCG itself but the games. Those games were inspired by the
TCG and are included within this application.

It's for fun. Let's have fun interacting with different APIs, Python GUI
programming, and data!
